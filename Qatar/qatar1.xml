We look at the life and adaptation throughout Ramadan of Adam Azim – an unbeaten professional boxer from the UK, Fares El Bakh – a weightlifter who won Qatar’s first ever Olympic gold medal, and Zainab Alema – a rugby player who is aiming to become the first player to represent England wearing a hijab.
